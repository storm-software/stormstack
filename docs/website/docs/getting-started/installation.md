The first task in getting started with the Broadridge FXL Application as a developer is to get the environment running locally so you may debug issues. This starts with installing the code locally. Please follow the below steps to begin:

1. Determine the path of your Broadridge FXL code repository locally.

:::note

This can vary depending on your local machine configuration, but the path will typically be something like "C:\Development\TwoFour Version 7.5\react-ui\broadridge-fxl"

:::

2. Open an command prompt in Windows by hitting the `start` button and typing "cmd", then hitting enter.

3. In the command prompt, navigate to the path found in step 1 using the `cd` command.

:::tip

If the path to your repo matched our example in step 1, you would use the command: `cd C:\Development\TwoFour Version 7.5\react-ui\broadridge-fxl`

:::

4. Ensure you are connected to the Broadridge network and execute the command `npm install`.

5. Watch the command prompt for any errors that may occur while running the install command above.

6. Ensure the node_modules folder is populated with the installed libraries

:::tip

If your repo path has matched ours, you would check for the libraries in "C:\Development\TwoFour Version 7.5\react-ui\broadridge-fx\node_modules"
